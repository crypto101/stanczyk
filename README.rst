Name and spelling
=================

`stanczyk` is named after `Stańczyk`_, a (historical) famous Polish
court jester. Other Crypto 101 projects (such as merlyn_, arthur_ and
clarent_) were already named after things from the court of Arthurian
legend; I picked Stańczyk because:

1. Poland is awesome.
2. This project looks simple, but it's actually pretty clever; perhaps
   more than its peers.
3. Poland is awesome.
